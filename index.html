                                Researchers Carolina Laura Morales and Anna
                                Traveset gathered data about flowering plants
                                growing alongside each other in various
                                locations. In each case, the researchers
                                identified
                                one plant as a “target species” and a nearby
                                plant as a “neighboring species.” The
                                researchers then calculated a value to show how
                                the neighboring species affected pollinator
                                visits to the target species. A negative effect
                                value indicates that the neighboring species
                                had a harmful effect on the target species.
                                Based on the table, two neighboring species that
                                had a harmful effect on target species are the
                                ________.

                                In a study of interactions between plants,
                                researchers Carolina Laura Morales and Anna
                                Traveset gathered data about flowering plants

                                locations. In each case, the researchers
                                identified one plant as a “target species” and a
                                nearby plant as a “neighboring species.” An
                                example of a neighboring species is the sticky
                                catchfly, which grows alongside the common
                                cow-wheat in ________.

                                High entropy alloys (HEAs) have been observed to
                                vary considerably in their resistance to
                                crack propagation, a quality denoted as fracture
                                toughness. It has been proposed that high
                                levels of fracture toughness in HEAs are due to
                                the use of arc melting during processing,
                                but

                                France, to the surrounding countryside.

                                great viaduct of Point du Jour which blocked the
                                river. It was the end of Paris, the
                                beginning of the country, and behind the double
                                row of arches the Seine, suddenly spreading
                                out as though it had regained space and liberty,
                                became all at once the peaceful river which
                                flows through the plains, alongside the wooded
                                hills, amid the meadows, along the edge of
                                the forests.

                            way to the front of the boat in a futile attempt to
                            hasten the journey’s end.

                            environment to the countryside and the changes in

                                Manchester United Football Club won more than

                                professional soccer club. Additionally,

                                mainly red, was more successful in home

                                whose home uniform color is not red. Research
                                has shown that many people associate the color
                                red with power and dominance. Past

                                The untaught peasant beheld the elements around
                                him and was acquainted with their practical
                                uses. The most learned philosopher knew little
                                more. He had partially unveiled the face of
                                Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a
                                wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,
                                anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of
                                a final cause, causes in their secondary and
                                tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I
                                had gazed upon the fortifications and
                                impediments that seemed to keep human beings
                                from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly
                                and ignorantly I had repined.

                                Researchers must be careful when predicting how
                                plants and animals will respond to future
                                environmental changes. Ecosystems are complex
                                and difficult to generalize about. Researchers
                                should not assume that a species will respond
                                the same way in every place and time. The best

                                few also have names such as 2089 Cetacea, which
                                is named after the animal clade that
                                includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises. But

                                300,000 minor planets discovered so far, the
                                sheer difficulty of finding a unique name for
                                each has greatly curtailed the practice such
                                that newly discovered minor planets are only
                                ________ given a name.

                                separately by 18 different women in
                                response to an experimenter’s instruction to
                                laugh. Analysis of the participants’
                                evaluations of the laughs prompted the team to
                                conclude that the ability to distinguish
                                between spontaneous and volitional laughter
                                appears to be universal across cultures.

                                The British Bronze Age began when sophisticated
                                techniques for making tools, weapons, and
                                other objects from metal were introduced to the
                                British Isles around 2500 BCE and it lasted
                                until around 700 BCE. In Britain during this
                                time, collections of valuable metal objects
                                (called hoards) were sometimes buried for
                                safekeeping. Some stayed buried for many
                                centuries, such as the Parc-y-Meirch hoard,
                                which was unearthed around 1868, and the
                                Fittleworth hoard, discovered in 1995. And

                                was
                                much rarer than bronze, however, and thus it is

                                2500 BCE to approximately 700 BCE. Collections
                                of metal items (called hoards) from all periods
                                of the Bronze Age have been found in
                                Britain, including the Llanarmon-yn-Iâl hoard of
                                artifacts from the 16th century BCE,
                                unearthed around 1982, and the much later
                                Horsehope Craig hoard of artifacts from the 7th
                                century BCE, unearthed around 1865. Sometime in
                                the Middle Bronze Age (approximately from
                                the 14th century BCE to the 10th century BCE),
                                metalsmiths in Britain began to develop
                                swords for the first time. This fact helps
                                explain why, whereas evidence of sword
                                production

                                Buried collections of Bronze Age metal items
                                (called hoards) have been found all over
                                Britain. For hoards discovered since the 1960s,
                                such as the 2003 discovery of the Crundale
                                hoard, advancements like inexpensive metal
                                detectors, ground-penetrating radar, and aerial
                                surveys have made it much easier for searchers
                                to locate hoards before putting the first
                                shovel in the ground. Hoards found before the
                                1960s, however, such as the discovery of the
                                Towednack hoard around 1931, were not aided by
                                such technologies and thus were much more

                                Efforts to automate the categorization of
                                literature into genres have faced substantial
                                challenges, questioning the utility of such
                                classifications. Genre definitions often lack
                                clarity, subjectivity, and reductionism,
                                detracting from their usefulness. In their

                                of the works of Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi
                                Adichie, researchers Olivia Smith and Chidi
                                Okonkwo contend that literary relationships
                                might be better understood through themes rather
                                than traditional genre labels.

                                Magical realism, a literary genre known from
                                Latin American authors like Gabriel García
                                Márquez, shares many thematic and stylistic
                                elements with the Southern Gothic genre.
                                Automated genre recognition tools often fail to
                                distinguish between such nuanced literary
                                categories. However, Zoe Harper and her team
                                addressed this issue by applying natural
                                language processing techniques to analyze
                                textual patterns. Their method shows promise in
                                enhancing genre recognition, potentially
                                benefiting readers and scholars alike.

                                researchers found that riprap—sloped retaining
                                walls consisting of various-sized rocks—is
                                negatively correlated with SAV abundance.
                                However, the researchers conceded that since
                                riprap tends to be found in areas with a high
                                degree of human activity, the correlation may
                                be an artifact of reductions in water quality
                                caused by that activity.

                                sparrow. Researcher Liana Zanette and colleagues
                                found that when this predation pressure on
                                song sparrows was temporarily reduced, their
                                numbers significantly increased. This finding

                                predators control prey population numbers.

                                In parts of British Columbia, Canada, the
                                Cooper’s hawk is a major predator of the song
                                sparrow. Researcher Liana Zanette and colleagues
                                found that when this predation pressure on
                                song sparrows was temporarily reduced, their
                                numbers significantly increased. This finding
                                illustrates a foundational ecological principle:
                                predators control prey population numbers.

                            It may be true for some predators but only because

                            findings of those studies
